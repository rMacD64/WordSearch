# User Guide to Word Search

This program requires FMSLogo, which can be downloaded for free here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo/

* Once downloaded, open the program and click Edall
  * Copy and paste the WordSearch code into the window
  * Then press File then Save and Exit or simply Ctrl+D

* Type “WordSearch” in the input bar
  * This should open up a window titled “Word Search”

* Begin the game by clicking the “Select Word” button with your mouse
  * If nothing happens, click the button again until something appears in the main window
  * This will create a list of numbers, 1 to 31, with a specific number of underscores beside each one: ranging from longest to shortest
  * It will also update the previous blank line at the bottom with a scrambled word, “hydrant”, to be exact

* Now, you can guess the unscrambled words that make up the word at the bottom, such as “hydrant”, “hand”, or “try”, by typing a guess in the input bar and then clicking the “Check” button at the bottom of the main window
  * If your guess is valid, then one of the lines of underscores will update and your guess will appear beside one of the numbers
  * Remember that each line of underscores represents the precise number of letters needed for that word, so shorter line lengths will be updated with smaller words

* In order to change your thinking/give yourself a hint, you can also click the “Scramble” button
  * This will further scramble your selected word, “hydrant”

* Then, if you have no further guesses and you give up, you can click the “Solution” button
  * This should update all of the blank lines with all of the unscrambled words that make up the word “hydrant” and give you all of the answers

* Finally, once your done playing the game, you can exit from the main window by clicking the “Quit” button
  * This should close the window titled “Word Search"
